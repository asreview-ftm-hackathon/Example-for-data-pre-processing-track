## Content
This reposity contains a script called
[`preprocess_files.ipynb`](/scripts/preprocess_files.ipynb), used for processing
the raw data into a more usable format, as well as removing noise and missing data.

Input data is provided by Follow The Money on their own [repository](https://github.com/ftmnl/asr).

The script stores the result file to `pre-processing/preprocessed.xlsx`.
