## Content

The data pre-processing track is a track that will help us to prepare the data
for the next track.

The `data` folder contains plain data as found in the ftm dataset.

The `scripts` folder contains scripts that will be used to prepare the plain
data.

The `output` folder contains the data that resulted from preprocessing, and that
will be used for the next tracks.
